## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Sahith Kasireddy, sk48663

#### Introduction 

My two datasets deal with data related to countries. One dataset, hif, is about the different examples of freedom from political scientists. The other dataset, renamed to UNImmigration, deals with the number of people leaving a country to a different country. I am interested in this dataset because I am really interested in cultures and the social and political systems of countries. 

I believe that there will be a positive correlation between the number of people entering a country and a country's overall human freedex index score as well as its individual index scores. Therefore, I would also believe that there would be a negative correlation between the number of people leaving a country and the country's overall human freedom index score as well as its individual index scores. I am also interested in varying data between the top countries of a certain category and the worst countries of a certain category. 

```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
hfi <- read.csv(file = 'hfi.csv')
UNImmigration <- read.csv(file ='CountryDataSet2.0.csv')

```

#### Tidying: Reshaping


```{R}
#Renaming variable, removing uneeded columns, and snapshot of sample
UNImmigration<- UNImmigration %>% rename("Country/Region of Destination" = Major.area..region..country.or.area.of.destination) %>% select(-c(1,3, 5:10)) 
UNImmigration %>% select(3:13) %>% slice(100:110)

#Filtering out uneeded observations and snapshot of sample after tidying
UNImmigration <- UNImmigration %>% pivot_longer(3:234, names_to="Country of Origin", values_to="Number of People Immigrating Out of Country")
UNImmigration <- UNImmigration %>% filter(`Country of Origin`!="Total" & `Country of Origin`!="Other North" & `Country of Origin`!="Other South")
UNImmigration %>% slice(2000, 75000, 100000, 254000, 400000)

```
One of the variables was renamed to 'Country/Region of Destination', which are the regions or countries that migrants are immigrating to. Extraneous columns were removed from the 'UNImmigration' dataset because they either do not have numerical value or will not be used later. The first headshot shows some observations of the data before tidying. Each individual country is its own variable as seen at the top of the headshot, which shows a sample of some of the countries. 

After tidying (pivot_longer) the dataset, columns 3 through 234 were selected from the 'UNImmigration dataset.' These countries became essentially combined into a column titled "Country of Origin" which are the countries in the dataset that migrants are migrating from. The numerical values under the untidied dataset were put under a column titled "Number of People Immigrating Out Country." Some observations were filtered out because they are total values and will not be used further. A headhsot of randomly picked observations from the tidied 'UNImmigration dataset' were picked.

    
#### Joining/Merging

```{R}

#Cleaning up hfi
hfi <- hfi %>% rename("Country of Origin" = `countries`, "Year" = year) %>% select(-c(1,3))

#Inner join and its analysis conducted

comparedf(x = hfi %>% slice(-(1:1458)) %>% select(c(1:3), pf_religion, pf_identity_sex, pf_rol_procedural, pf_ss_disappearances_disap, pf_movement_women, pf_association_association, pf_association_assembly, pf_expression, pf_identity_divorce,ef_regulation, hf_score), y = UNImmigration %>% slice(-(1:381640)))


summary(comparedf(hfi %>% slice(-(1:1458)) %>% select(c(1:3), pf_religion, pf_identity_sex, pf_rol_procedural, pf_ss_disappearances_disap, pf_movement_women, pf_association_association, pf_association_assembly, pf_expression, pf_identity_divorce,ef_regulation, hf_score), UNImmigration %>% slice(-(1:381640))))

```
After filtering out unneeded regions from both the 'Country/Region of Destination' varible and the 'Country of Origin' variable in the UNImmigration dataset, Regex (regular expressions) were used to make sure that the common countries between the two datasets were spelled the same. The two unique ID variables in the UNImmigration dataset: 'Country of Destination' and "Number of People Immigrating Out of Country". The unique ID variables in the hfi dataset are numerous. There are 120 unique variables of 122 variables (only 'Year' and 'Country of Origin' are not unique). Some of the unique ID variables in the 'hif' that I will be using are 'pf_religion, pf_identity_sex, pf_rol_procedural, pf_ss_disappearances_disap, pf_movement_women, pf_association_association, pf_association_assembly, pf_expression, pf_identity_divorce,ef_regulation, and hf_score' (All of this is shown in the summary of the compare data frame code of the datasets, that were very filtered, for simplicity sake).

An inner join was performed in order to match the data values from the UNImmigration dataset to the hfi dataset. An inner join was performed instead of other types of joins in order to keep data that only matched, , which meant that 309260 observations were dropped, considering that there were 72380 observations in the joinedDataSet. This will not create an issue for my analyssi because I only wanted data that was matched between both sets to make analysis consistent. Additionally, because I will be using variables from both datasets in my graphs, I did not want there to be data accounted for in that graph that did not come from both sets.

####  Wrangling

Before exploring my data, I made sure to convert and blank observations or observations with .. into NA values. Afterwards, I selected only the variables of interest and created a new variable with the function "mutate" to show the percent change in immigration from and to a country between the years 2015 and 2010. The 'hf_score' variable is the total hf_score from the 'joinedDataSet' rather than my own averaged hf_score. I also found the number of NAs in each column, which varied from 0 to 56086. I also found the frequency of each categorical variable as well (Year is treated as a categorical variable rather than numeric because it does not present value standalone unlike the other numeric variables). 

Respective summary tables were created for each numeric variable, at first, by themselves, and then paired with one, and two categorical variables. I also created my own function to use as one of the statistics in one of my summary tables. 

#### Visualizing

```{R}
library(ggplot2)

densityregulation <- joinedDataSet %>% filter(Year==2015)

mu <- joinedDataSet %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(grp.mean = mean(ef_regulation))
mu


ggplot(densityregulation, aes(x=ef_regulation, fill=region)) +geom_density(alpha=.75) + theme(legend.position=c(.3,.5)) +
geom_vline(data = mu, aes(xintercept = grp.mean, color = region), linetype = "dashed") +
ggtitle("Density Plot of Market Regulation Scores by Region")+xlab("Regulation Scores")+ylab("Density")


```
This density plot indicates the regulation scores for the 2015 year for different regions across the world. Furthermore, mean lines were added in order to highlight the mean for the respective regions' mean regulation scores. 
This density plot shows that the countries that have higher market regulation are the ones that are furthest to the right. These include North America and Western Europe. Furthermore, it is evident that around a regulation score of around 7, there is some overlap between Western Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Latin America, which highlights that this is a common regulation score for many countries in those regions to be around.

```{R}


joinedDataSet %>% group_by(`Country of Origin`, Year) %>% filter(!is.na(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`) & (!is.na(pf_religion))) %>% summarise("Total Number of People Immigrating Out of Country" = sum(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`))  %>% arrange(`Total Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`) %>% filter(n()>1)

joinedDataSet %>% group_by(`Country of Origin`, Year) %>% filter(!is.na(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`) & (!is.na(pf_religion))) %>% summarise("Total Number of People Immigrating Out of Country" = sum(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`))  %>% arrange(desc(`Total Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`)) %>% filter(n()>1)

                                                                                                                    Top5Low5ByNumberOfPeopleLeaving <- joinedDataSet %>% filter(!is.na(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`)) %>% filter(`Country of Origin`=="United States"|`Country of Origin`=="United Kingdom"|`Country of Origin`=="Russia"|`Country of Origin`=="India"|`Country of Origin`=="Philippines"|`Country of Origin`=="Botswana"|`Country of Origin`=="Swaziland"|`Country of Origin`=="Timor-Leste"|`Country of Origin`=="Lesotho"|`Country of Origin`=="Pap. New Guinea")  %>% group_by(`Country of Origin`, Year) %>% mutate("Number of People Immigrating Out of Country" = sum(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`))                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                       
ggplot(Top5Low5ByNumberOfPeopleLeaving, aes(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`, pf_religion))+ geom_point(size=5, aes(color= `Country of Origin`)) + geom_line(alpha = .1) + ggtitle("Relationship between Religious Freedom and Number of People Leaving a Country")+xlab("Number of People Leaving Country")+ylab("Religion Index Score") + facet_grid(rows = vars(Year)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,2500000,250000)) + theme(text = element_text(size=), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, size=9))



```

Because I knew that I wanted to facet my data, I had to filter my data accordingly. I wanted the top 5 countries with the most immigrants and the top 5 countries with the least immigrants if they did not have missing data for the religious index score for both years (2010 and 2015) I then made a new dataset for this titled 'Top5Low5ByNumberOfPeopleLeaving' by filtering the original dataset with the respective countries.

The overall pattern of the ggplot does not change too much in 5 years, as seen by the consistent shape of both the geom_line as well as the points, which correspond to countries, on the graph. Overall, it seems as if the countries with the highest religious index scores seemed to have both how and low number of immigrants. This was suprising to me because I would have thought that there would only be a postive linear relationship between the number of people leaving a country and a country's religious index. 


```{R}
joinedDataSet %>% filter(Year==2015) %>% group_by(`Country of Origin`) %>% arrange(desc(hf_score)) %>% filter(`Country/Region of Destination`=="Afghanistan") %>% select(3, 16)

joinedDataSet %>% filter(Year==2015) %>% group_by(`Country of Origin`) %>% arrange(hf_score) %>% filter(`Country/Region of Destination`=="Afghanistan") %>% select(3, 16)

RankedbyHF<- joinedDataSet %>% filter(!is.na(`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`)) %>% filter(`Country/Region of Destination`=="Syria"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Libya"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Egypt"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Yemen, Rep."|`Country/Region of Destination`=="New Zealand"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Hong Kong"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Switzerland"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Ireland"|`Country/Region of Destination`=="Australia") %>% group_by(`Country/Region of Destination`) %>% filter(Year==2015) 


RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination` <- str_replace_all(RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination`, "(Bolivarian Republic of)", "")
RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination` <- str_replace_all(RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination`, "()", "")
RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination` <- str_replace_all(RankedbyHF$`Country/Region of Destination`, "Yemen, Rep.", "Yemen")

ggplot(RankedbyHF, aes(x = `Country/Region of Destination`)) + geom_bar(aes(y=`Number of People Immigrating Out of Country`), stat="summary", fun=mean) + ggtitle("Mean Number of People Immigrating to the Top 5 Best and Worst Ranked Countries by Overall Freedom Index")+xlab("Countries")+ylab("Number of People Entering Country") + theme(text = element_text(size=8), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, size=7))

```

I first created a dataset titled RankedbyHF which used code to find the top 5 countries with the highest overall human index score as well as the bottom 5 countries with the lowest overall human index score from the Year 2015. The top 5 countries by overall human index are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Ireland, and Australia in order. The worst 5 countries, starting from the worst score, are Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, Libya, and Egypt. Then, using this dataset, and cleaning up names with str_replace, the ggplot of a bar graph was created. 

This bar graph shows that the country with the highest mean number of emigranis is Hong Kong while the country with the lowest mean number of emigrants is Egypt. Ireland and New Zealand are the two countries that despite having high overall Human Index scores seem to have lower emigrants than the countries with the worst overall human index scores, which was a suprise, considering that the other top HF scoring countries had higher emigrants than any low scoring country.
